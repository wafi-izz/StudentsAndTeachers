public interface Person {
    void getAttandenceString();
}


//Create 'Person' interface and that interface should have getAttandenceString() function.
//
//Create two class Teacher and  Student. Both should have necessary fields.
//
//Last step update the Italian and Math class's takeAttandence function's parameter to Person type and just call getAttandenceString()
